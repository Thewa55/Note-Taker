When you first clone the repo run "npm i" in terminal to download dependency. Once it's done run "node server" in terminal and go to "http://localhost:8080/" in your browser.
## #Usage
With this program you are able to easily and quickly create, save and delete notes. 

When you first load into the program either through heroku or cloning the repo, you will be greeted by the landing page:

This is my first time using a promise chain to solve my async issue I had with using express to fetch data on the search page:
